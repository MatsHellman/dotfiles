# My simple dotfiles

> Mats Hellman |Â October 8th 2020  

This repository contains my very simple dotfiles I use in my Linux installations.  
There are thousands and thousands of these repos on Github, but this one is mine, just like in the old great movie by Stanley Kubrik.  
Everyone needs their own repo to have their personal preferences. If you find something you can use here, good for you, don't hold any issues against me.
